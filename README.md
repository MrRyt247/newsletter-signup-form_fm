## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- jQuery

### What I learned

I learnt form validation with JavaScript. How to write a regex script to check for valid email addresses.

```js
// Email validation regex
const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
```

### Continued development

jQuery
